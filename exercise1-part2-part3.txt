Q: What data format checks should you implement to make code robust


A: Robust code is one which handles unexpected actions and abnormal terminations.

   1.Validation and verification are two ways to check that the data entered into a computer is correct.
     add format checks to ckeck entered data is in the specified format like dates have to be in the format dd mm yyyy

   2.Add Data type checks which Checks the data type of the input and give an error message if the input data does not match with the chosen data type
  
   3.add exceptions to handle abnormal actions and errors and give detailed error messages.

   4.Add methods to check overflow of arrays.
   
   5.limit the accesibilty of methods and members of code.




Q: what is time complexity of your program

A:
   Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, where an elementary operation takes a fixed amount    of time to perform
   since my code has more functions and more assignments the time taken is constant.O(1).
